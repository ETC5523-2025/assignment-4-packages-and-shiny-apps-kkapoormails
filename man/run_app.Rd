\title{Launch the Quarantine Breach Risk Dashboard}
\usage{
run_app()
}
\value{
Invisibly launches the Shiny app; no R object is returned.
}
\description{
Starts the interactive Shiny dashboard bundled with the
\code{assignment4shinykkapoor} package.
}
\details{
The dashboard lets you:
\itemize{
\item choose an Australian state / territory (e.g. NSW, VIC, WA, ...),
\item choose a risk type:
\itemize{
\item \code{total}: overall modelled quarantine outbreak risk,
\item \code{breach}: risk attributed specifically to quarantine system failures
(not always available for every state or every date),
}
\item pick a date range,
\item visualise how daily estimated risk changes over time,
\item view a sortable table of the filtered daily values,
\item read an automatically generated plain-English summary highlighting
when risk was highest.
}

Data comes from \code{covid_breach_data}, derived from modelling of
quarantine breach / outbreak risk during the emergence of Delta
(Lydeamore et al., 2023, \emph{Science Advances}), provided in ETC5523.

Important limitation: some combinations of state and risk type do not have
non-missing values (for example, national "breach" is mostly NA). The app
will warn you when there is no usable data for your selection.
