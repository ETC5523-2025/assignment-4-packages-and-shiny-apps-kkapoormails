\title{Launch the Quarantine Breach Risk Explorer}
\usage{
run_app()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the Shiny app object.
}
\description{
This function starts the interactive Shiny dashboard included with the
\pkg{CovidRiskExplorer} package. The dashboard allows users to:
\itemize{
\item select an Australian state or territory,
\item choose a risk type (overall quarantine risk vs. breach-related risk),
\item adjust a date range to focus on specific time periods,
\item explore interactive plots of daily modelled risk over time,
\item inspect tabular daily values, and
\item read automatically generated narrative summaries describing
risk peaks and average levels.
}
}
\details{
The data visualised in the app is sourced from the \code{covid_breach_data}
dataset, derived from Lydeamore et al. (2023), \emph{Science Advances 9(3): abm3624},
supplied in the ETC5523 unit at Monash University.
