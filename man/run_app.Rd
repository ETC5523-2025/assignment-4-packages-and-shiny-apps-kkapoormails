\title{Launch the Quarantine Breach Risk Dashboard}
\usage{
run_app()
}
\value{
This function does not return a value; it launches the Shiny app.
}
\description{
This function starts the interactive Shiny app bundled with the
\code{CovidRiskExplorer} package.
}
\details{
The dashboard allows you to:
\itemize{
\item select an Australian state/territory,
\item choose a risk type (overall quarantine risk vs breach-related risk),
\item choose a date range,
\item view how daily estimated risk changes over time,
\item inspect a table of daily values,
\item read an automatically generated plain-English summary that explains when risk was highest.
}

The data used in the app is \code{covid_breach_data}, which is derived
from modelling of quarantine outbreak/breach risk during the Delta period
(Lydeamore et al., 2023, Science Advances) and provided in ETC5523.
