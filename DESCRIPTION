Description: This package was developed for the ETC5523 Communicating with Data unit at Monash University.
    It includes:
    (1) a cleaned and documented dataset ('covid_breach_data') derived from daily modelled quarantine
    outbreak / breach risk estimates for Australian states and territories during the emergence of the
    SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (Lydeamore et al., 2023, Science Advances),
    (2) helper functions for accessing and summarising that data,
    (3) an interactive Shiny dashboard ("Quarantine Breach Risk Explorer") that allows users to
    select a state/region, choose a risk measure (overall quarantine risk vs breach-attributed risk),
    focus on a date range, and interpret periods of elevated risk, and
    (4) a pkgdown site and vignette explaining the communication choices.
    The goal is to communicate risk trends to a non-technical audience in a reproducible way.
